# URL SHORTENER: 

**Description**:  
A URL shortener with node.js/express.js and mongoDB on heroku. 

**Instructions**:  
After you've obtained your shortened link, you can view the stats page of your given link by adding a '+' at the end.
For example, if your shortened link ends with '/3qs8at+'. If you enter '/3qs8at+', you'll see a graph with the total visits/clicks on the link and the number of clicks per day. The d3 library was used to generate the graphs. JQuery was also used for AJAX calls to the database.
